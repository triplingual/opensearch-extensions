opensearch-extensions
==========================

Some (well, _two_ right now) search extensions made for OpenSearch (Fx/IE/Cr)

These were done with only moderate experience using OpenSearch, so there may be glaring inefficiencies or inelegancies about them. Please help improve them.


Add to Chrome

1. Paste the appropriate line below in your address bar, then type `javascript:` in front of it (Chrome strips out that part when you paste), then press enter.
1. In the popup, it's recommended to set a keyword


Add to Firefox

1. Paste the line in, press enter
